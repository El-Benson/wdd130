        Viewing the World today, all advancements, technology, Facts, and improvements in the world are gotten from educated persons knowing them through means of information we see. Seeing all positivity in our environments, communities, nations and as a people, we see that all positive aspects in our life are a result of what education has done, is doing, and will do in the future when we hold firm with a strong desire to aspire in different fields that enrich the earth potential of global continues development. Mark Twain states that If itâ€™s done right, education inspires young minds to envision a brighter future. Not only that but it also gives them the necessary tools and skills to confidently make that vision a reality. Looking at this I see the advantage of education in our society and see that education is a very vital part of being human as to learn things are they are as they are to be and how they can be positive with great impact in creating or organizing things that modify and develops our way of living. Education gives us the will to make sensory faculty of the world around us, the world inside of us, and where we fit within the world. Education gives us a sense of new ideas and notions that we can use to appreciate and improve the world around us and the world        within us.
        As we continue with the desire for our education and continue to learn, we can accelerate and simulate new connections, increase our skills, and understand people better.
